Approach:

1) I used a top-down analysis for this project.
2) I began by writing pseudo-code and then built code modules.
3) I used test scenarios and each module was unit tested.
4) I did integration and end-to-end testing for the application as a whole.

# FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS

1) New Tic-Tac-Toe game should be created after Sign In on the web application.
2) Modify code to be more modularized with functions separated out into their own
   scripts.
